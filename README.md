# CS-330---Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

#How do I approach designing software?
  When it comes to designing new software, I like to look at the project in it's entirity to gain the big picture of the project. After I see what the end goal of the project is, I like to 

#What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new skills I have learned on this project is how to use basic shapes and build them to turn them into complex shapes. I can also take these shapes and add textures and lighting so that they can replicate a 2D scene into a 3D one. 

#What design process did you follow for your project work?
I broke the project into multiple steps week by week so that by the 7th week I had a full project that I was able to add finshing touches into instead of taking the project all on at one time. 

#How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
By doing this, it has taught me how to self pace and not take too much on at one time making the task too over whelming. 

#How do I approach developing programs?
I take developing programs step by step so that I can see the entire program in its entirity. I also try to put functions into the program so that it can be reusable across the code. 

#What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
New developments I used was adding textures to the items so that they look more like the item I am trying to replicate. 

#How did iteration factor into your development?
I put the same iteration in for the key movement and mouse movement so that everytime a key is pressed, it will complete the same action which is moving the camera.

#How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
By adding the new code to the same project week over week, I was able to employ the new code so that in the end they worked seamlessly together to build the project to be whole. 

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me complete my goals because it shows me the baseline of becoming something such as a Scrum Master. It shows me what someone would do in the agile process and how the team wuld run sprints to complete goals. 

#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This class helped me further undertsand how to code in C++ and understand how the functions and loops work. With that I can build on the knowledge to take me into further projects. 

#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I can use this class to help see how coding graphics would work if I wanted to go into the field of making video games or making graphics for a website.

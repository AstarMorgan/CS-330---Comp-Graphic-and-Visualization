#How do I approach designing software?
  When it comes to designing new software, I like to look at the project in it's entirity to gain the big picture of the project. After I see what the end goal of the project is, I like to 

#What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new skills I have learned on this project is how to use basic shapes and build them to turn them into complex shapes. I can also take these shapes and add textures and lighting so that they can replicate a 2D scene into a 3D one. 

#What design process did you follow for your project work?
I broke the project into multiple steps week by week so that by the 7th week I had a full project that I was able to add finshing touches into instead of taking the project all on at one time. 

#How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
By doing this, it has taught me how to self pace and not take too much on at one time making the task too over whelming. 

#How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
